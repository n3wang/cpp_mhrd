Description: Interactive HDL puzzle game and circuit simulator
 minlab is a terminal-based puzzle game inspired by MHRD where you build
 digital circuits using HDL (Hardware Description Language).
 .
 Features:
  * Interactive level-based gameplay with progressive difficulty
  * Terminal UI with tabbed interface (Solution, Instructions, Stats, History)
  * Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for efficient editing
  * Real-time syntax checking and error reporting
  * Circuit simulation with truth table validation
  * Progress tracking and solution history
 .
 The game includes multiple levels teaching digital circuit design through
 hands-on HDL programming. Players learn to build gates, combinational circuits,
 and more complex digital logic.
