# Base UX Improvements

Create a better UX experience for using the IDE
- Using tab should move betweeen your solution, and instructions, and other stat tabs
- Shift Enter for compiling
- It should tell you for sytax errors
- After compiling it shouldnt delete all the code
- Can view your last worked code


The menu can use both: the numbers for quick selection and arrows to move between the options (different highlights) this menu  component should be refactorable and reusable
